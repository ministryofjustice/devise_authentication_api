=== unicorn 4.8.0 - big internal changes, but compatible / 2014-01-11 07:34 UTC

  This release contains fairly major internal workings of master-to-worker
  notifications.  The master process no longer sends signals to workers
  for most tasks.  This works around some compatibility issues with some
  versions of the "pg" gem (and potentially any other code which may not
  handle EINTR properly).  One extra benefit is it also helps stray
  workers notice a rare, unexpected master death more easily.  Workers
  continue to (and will always) accept existing signals for compatibility
  with tools/scripts which may signal workers.

  PID file are always written early (even on upgrade) again to avoid
  breaking strange monitoring setups which use PID files.  Keep in mind we
  have always discouraged monitoring based on PID files as they are
  fragile.

  We now avoid bubbling IOError to the Rack app on premature client
  disconnects when streaming the input body.  This is usually not a
  problem with nginx, but may be on some LAN setups without nginx).

  Thanks to Sam Saffron, Jimmy Soho, Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas,
  Michael Fischer, and Andrew Hobson for their help with this release.

  Note: the unicorn mailing list will be moved/changed soon due to the
  RubyForge shutdown.  unicorn will always rely only on Free Software.
  There will never be any sign-up requirements nor terms-of-service to
  agree to when communicating with us.
